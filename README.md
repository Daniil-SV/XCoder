## Textures <a name = "texture_main"></a>
This version has some changes compared to ["original"](https://github.com/vorono4ka/Xcoder) python one.
The main goal is to provide maximum flexibility by removing dumb restrictions..
Because of this, here all information about textures is contained in readable json and not in binary .xcod files.
Json is composed of a list of textures that can be changed or added to.
Below is a table with a description of each parameter of such a texture.
Each parameter can be optional

- All descriptions are taken from ["supercell-swf](https://github.com/scwmake/supercell-swf-ts/wiki)

## Decoding .sc to .png <a name = "texture_decoding"></a>
To decode sc to png you need to copy your files to  ```Sc-Textures/In-SC-Textures/```
and run the operation in XCoder, after that get folders with output in ```Sc-Textures/Out-Textures/```.
Folders contain textures and a ["json"](#texture_main) file with information about them.

## Encoding from .png to .sc <a name = "texture_encoding"></a>
You have 2 ways:
1. ["Decode"](#texture_decoding) and modify existing files and add them to ```Sc-Textures/In-Textures/```.
2. You can create textures from scratch. Create a folder in ```Sc-Textures/In-Textures/``` with name of texture and put png there. Json file is optional.

After that, you can get files in ```Sc-Textures/Out-SC-Textures/```.

<br/><br/>

## Comressing <a name = "compressing_main"></a>
There are also changes here. In Python version, compressor could only decompress csv files. This one supports compression of all files. Be careful if you want to compress or decompress a .sc file, make sure its name ends in ".sc".

## File decompressing <a name = "decompressing"></a>
Place your files in ```Compressing/In-Compressed-files/```, start decompression operation and take files in ```Compressing/Out-files```.
### Terminal access:
To decompress file, run following command:
```
sc-decompress
```

Command arguments:
```
-i, --input : Required parameter. Path to folder with files or path to file. If a folder is specified and no output is specified, creates a new folder with "_decompressed" prefix that will contain processed files.

-o, --output : Optional parameter. Name of output file. If not specified and if input is a file then it will be overwritten.
```

Examples:
```
sc-decompress -i sc/ui.sc -o sc/ui_decompressed.sc
````
<strong> OR </strong>
```
sc-decompress -i sc/
```
<em><strong>output will automatically be "sc_decompressed/"</strong></em>.

## File compressing <a name = "compressing"></a>
Place your files in ```Compressing/In-files/```, start compression operation and take files in ```Compressing/Out-compressed-files/```.
Uses compression method currently selected in XCoder.
### Terminal access:
To compress file, run following command:
```
sc-compress
```

Command arguments:
```
-i, --input : Required parameter. Path to folder with files or path to file. If a folder is specified and no output is specified, creates a new folder with "_compressed" prefix that will contain processed files.

-o, --output : Optional parameter. Name of output file. If not specified and if input is a file then it will be overwritten.
```

Examples:
```
sc-compress -i sc/ui_decompressed.sc -o  sc/ui.sc
````
<strong> OR </strong>
```
sc-decompress -i sc/
```
<em><strong>output will automatically be "sc_compressed/"</strong></em>.
